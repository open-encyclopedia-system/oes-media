# Open Encyclopedia System Plugin

Welcome to the Open Encyclopedia System Media (OES Media) repository on GitHub. OES is a modular and configurable software for creating, publishing and maintaining online encyclopedias in the humanities and social sciences that are accessible worldwide via Open Access. For more information please visit the main repository or our website.

A typical OES application consists of an OES plugin and an additional OES project plugin which implements the OES features for the application. The OES Media plugin is an additional OES module to include media blocks and functionalities.

## Documentation (Coming Soon)

We are working on a detailed user manual and a technical function reference. Support is currently provided via our email help desk info@open-encyclopedia-system.org. We answer questions related to the OES plugin and its usage.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

OES Media depends on the OES Core Plugin:
* OES Core, version 2.3.3, URL: https://github.com/open-encyclopedia-system/oes-core.

OES Media depends on the WordPress plugin ACF PRO:
* Advanced Custom Fields, version 6.3.4, URL: https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/.


### Installation

1. Download the OES plugin from gitHub and add it to your WordPress plugin directory.
2. Download and activate the dependencies.
3. Activate the OES plugin.
4. Create your OES project plugin or download and activate the OES Demo plugin.
